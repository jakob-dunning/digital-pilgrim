# The Digital Pilgrim
A scraper as an art project.

The digital pilgrim is a lone wanderer on the internet. He starts at a place on the internet, visits some or all pages of the current site, finds new paths to walk and continues - if possible indefinitely.

There was an idea to give the pilgrim a higher purpose than wandering, but so far, except for offering a glimpse into his doing (currently only throough a local monitor), that's all he does.
